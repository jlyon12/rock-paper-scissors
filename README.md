Rock Paper Scissors Revisited - The Odin Project JS project #1.

Purpose is to use DOM manipulation to play a game of rock, paper, or scissors.

Prior to this ; created game logic to be played in console. Used similar game logic here.

In this project I learned about DOM manipulation and dynamic webpage responsiveness via event listener.

The reset game button reloads the page. No score is kept game-to-game.
